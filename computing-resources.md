# What computing resources are available ?

For some projects, a powerful personal computer might be sufficient. 

For some projects, you might need a high-performance computing environment.
We have a few options.

## Computational servers provided by the lab
We have decently powerful computational servers.
If you request, you will be provided key-based ssh access.
The machines run Linux.

## Computational servers provided by CCS.
