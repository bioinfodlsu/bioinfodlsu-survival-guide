# Are there any bioinformatics (text)-books?

A comprehensive textbook for bioinformatics perhaps does not exist.
It's hard to write one, because the field is moving rapidly, students have varying backgrounds, etc.

Nonetheless, here are some recommendations to learn the foundational concepts in bioinformatics and biology.
