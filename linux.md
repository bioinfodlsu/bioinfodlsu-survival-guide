# Do I need to learn Linux?

Maybe not, most likely yes. 

Most bioinformatics software are built for Unix-like operating systems.
One reason for this is that bioinformatics projects tend to be free and open-source and so need a similar eco-system.
Another reason is that bioinformatics tools need to run on high-performance-computing environments or on cloud computing resources, 
all of which run on Unix-like systems.

Luckily, even if you are only used to Windows, it is very easy these days to install a modern Linux OS on a virtual machine using VirtualBox or VMware or WSL.
