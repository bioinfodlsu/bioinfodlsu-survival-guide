# Bioinformatics Lab Survival Guide 

The objective of this document is to provide reference material for questions often asked by students planning to join or starting out at the Bioinformatics Lab.

The title is a misnomer -- this is not a guide for surviving, but for thriving. 
If you strive, you will thrive. 

A warm welcome to the Bioinformatics Lab.
