# What software development skill do I need?
The first thing is obviously knowing and choosing programming language(s) appropriate for your task.
Here's a short discussion on that here: {ref}`content:programming_languages`

Let's say you are writing a super cool software that does amazing things.

You should version control it using Git.

And you should want to make it open-source and f


Surely, you want the world to use it. If your software has a lot of dependencies, you might want to containerize it.



## Version control using Git and GitHub

## Conda
- https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html

When you install a package via Conda, it searches for the package in repositories (called channels). If the package is not available in Conda's default channel, alternative channels include [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) and [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/).

Conda's dependency resolution tends to be slow, so here are some faster alternatives:
